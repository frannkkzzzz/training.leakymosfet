##### Functions of MOSFET in Laptops
On a PC, MOSFETs help make up the VRM (voltage regulator module), which controls how much voltage other components on the motherboard, like the CPU or graphics card, receive.

PC components like CPUs and graphics cards have strict operating voltages, so a motherboard’s VRM helps make sure this isn’t exceeded. MOSFETs are important to VRM functionality and have an impact on the amount of heat being generated by a VRM while it’s doing its job. MOSFETs can get quite toasty if you’re using a powerful graphics card, and a  motherboard’s heatsink helps cool the MOSFETs and, thus, the VRM. In addition to keeping the overall system safe, keeping MOSFETs cool is also important for any type of overclocking.
